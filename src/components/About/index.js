            Hello! My name is Thomas Siffermann, I am currently looking for Junior Development position. After attaining my Bachelors in Business from Belmont University, and spending a couple years in the workforce. 
            I decided I was ready for a change, ready to take on a new challenge, and develop new skills as a web developer. I am currently attending a coding bootcamp through Butler University. 
            I have worked through HTML, CSS, and beginning to tackle Javascript.
